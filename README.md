# Phising-Website_Detection
# Introduction
In the last decades, the web and online services have revolutionized the modern world. However, by increasing our dependence on online services, as a result, online security threats are also increasing rapidly. One of the most common online security threats is a so-called Phishing attack, the purpose of which is to mimic a legitimate website such as online banking, e-commerce or social networking website in order to obtain sensitive data such as user-names, passwords, financial and health-related information from potential victims. The problem of detecting phishing websites has been addressed many times using various methodologies from conventional classifiers to more complex hybrid methods.
